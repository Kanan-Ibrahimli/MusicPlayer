					<p class="card__info">Muslim Magometovich Magomayev dubbed the "Soviet Sinatra", was a Soviet, 
					Azerbaijani and Russian opera and pop singer. He achieved iconic status in Russia and the post-Soviet 
					countries for his vocal talent and charisma. People's Artist of the USSR. <br> 
					He was 19 when he first performed at an international youth music festival in Helsinki. His performance 
					was noted by Yekaterina Furtseva, then Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, who offered him to be a 
					soloist at the Bolshoi Theatre. Magomayev declined the offer. In 1962, at the age of 20, Magomayev first 
					appeared in Moscow where he performed during the Days of Azerbaijani Culture. He sang an aria from 
					Gounodâ€™s Faust, and the song "Do the Russians Want War?" in a gala concert at the Kremlin Palace of
					Congresses, and became a celebrity on the spot.He recorded three songs with Azerbaijani composer Asya 
					Sultanova. A year later, he gave his first solo concert in the Moscow Tchaikovsky Concert Hall to a full
					house and became a soloist of the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater. Muslim earned fame 
					in the USSR as an opera singer with his performance in Rossini's "The Barber of Seville". He also became 
					known for his arias from Puccini's "Tosca", Hajibeyov's "Koroghlu" and "Shah Ismayil", which was composed
					by his grandfather.<br>In 1964 and 1965, Muslim was a visiting artist at La Scala in Milan, but turned 
					down the invitation to sing in the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre upon his return. Instead, the singer turned to 
					popular music, becoming a cult figure of soviet estrada for several generations of music lovers in the 
					Soviet Union. Muslim Magomayev's popularity in the USSR was overwhelming. He used to gave three concerts a
					day filling huge arenas all across the Soviet Union, while his albums sold millions. In 1966 and 1969, 
					Magomayev performed in Olympia with great success. The director of Olympia Bruno Coquatrix offered him a 
					contract, and Magomayev was seriously considering an opportunity to pursue an international career, but 
					Yekaterina Furtseva refused to grant the Ministry of Culture's permission, claiming that it needed Magomayev
					to perform at government concerts. In 1969, he received the Midem Gold Disc Award in Cannes for album sales of 
					over 4.5 million units. In 1973, at the age of 31, Muslim was awarded the Soviet Union's highest artistic title: 
					People's Artist of the USSR. Magomayev moved to Moscow in the early 1970s. He became the art director of the 
					Azerbaijan State Bandstand-Symphonic Orchestra in 1975 and toured in Italy, France, Bulgaria, Finland, Canada, 
					United States, Cuba and other countries. Magomayev was also known as a composer, writing several film soundtracks 
					and songs. In addition, Magomayev acted in films and hosted television and radio broadcasts devoted to prominent 
					musicians of the 20th century. Magomayev was an influence on many important Soviet musical figures including Alla 
					Pugacheva, who often spoke fondly of him.</p>

					held among amateur singers and judged by prominent Azerbaijani composers and musicians, such as 
					Uzeyir Hajibeyov and Bulbul. She performed Qarabagh shikastasi at the Azerbaijan State Opera and
					Ballet Theatre in Baku and was chosen by Hajibeyov to join the newly formed Azerbaijan State Choir, 
					where Alakbarova started her professional career as a singer. As a teenager, she was vocally trained 
					by mugham instructor Aghalar Aliverdibeyov and opera singer Huseyngulu Sarabski. At the early stage of
					her career, she mostly performed folk songs. <br>During the Second World War while giving concerts to soldiers
					in hospitals, train stations, military units, Alakbarova first sang patriotic war songs composed by 
					Hajibeyov. She would make up to 50 performances a day, including those in distant places such as
